World's Worst Chess Engine

I challenged myself to write a rudimenatary chess engine in four hours. That initial challenge was a qualified success, and you can find it on the main branch. Here on the bugfixes branch I'm making small improvements and bug fixes based on that initial four hour work. Total time invested will still be about 8 hours.

Currently not implemented:
1) En passant
2) Castling
3) Pawn promotion to anything other than a queen
4) Human player input (plays only with itself)

Changes that would make it a better engine:
1) Understanding of openings
2) Understanding of end game
3) Better position evaluation (currently avoids check and min-maxes the point value of pieces remaining on the board)

Known bugs:

Don't code like this. MIT License. Have fun!
